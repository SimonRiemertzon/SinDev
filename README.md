# SinDev
This is my attempt to create a blog and a place to market myself in a low effort high reward way! I'm writing these notes in Obsidian and then publish them here. At some point I might transfer these to some kind of portfolio website, but that is getting ahead of myself... Enjoy! 

# Obsidian and Enveloppe 
The PRs to this repo is created by using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a note-taking tool and then publish the notes with a plugin called [Enveloppe](https://github.com/Enveloppe/obsidian-enveloppe).
